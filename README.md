JavaBat
=======

Methods from JavaBat. Organized with working test cases.

Timing for initial runs are exact (to the second) via CodingBat and are based on Eastern Standard / Daylight Time.
Dates follow the DD/MM/YY format.
The primary reason this repo was created was to get better with writing unit tests / test cases, and to keep my git skills fresh.
